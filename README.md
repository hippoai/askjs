# Directed property graph storage and traversal

With a Gremlin-like API, create and traverse your directed property graphs.

This is fully compatible with [GraphGo](https://github.com/hippoai/graphgo.git) and follows the traversal implementation in [AskGo](https://github.com/hippoai/askgo.git)


## How to use
